    <h1>Voxel Model Generation</h1>
    <p>
      The ArcPy script &quot;Generate Voxel&quot; allows for the creation of voxels from ArcGIS Polygon layers.
      It accepts an unlimited amount of layers and creates a user-defined amount of voxels between the top and 
      bottom layers of a stratum.

    <p>
      This image shows the naming conventions for the layers. The top-layer of a stratum has to be infront of 
      the bottom-layer, alphabetically. For example, these input layers would create three sets of voxels. One 
      between the layers <b>Layer_1a</b> and <b>Layer_1b</b>. Another one between the layers <b>Layer_1b</b> 
      and <b>Layer_2a</b>. And one between the layers <b>Layer_2a</b> and <b>Layer_2b</b>.

    <p>
      This image shows an example of generated voxels, displayed as points. 15,625 (25 per axis) voxels per 
      stratum have been created.
    </p>
    <p>
      These voxels do not have the proper symbology yet. To fix this, follow the instructions in the log-file 
      of the tool.

    <p>
      This image shows the voxels with proper symbology. 1,000 (10 per axis) voxels per stratum have been 
      created.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/Voxel_generator_50x50x50.JPG" width="700" height="300" />  
    <p>
      This image also shows voxels with proper symbology. 125,000 (50 per axis) voxels per stratum have been 
      created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The run-time of this tool is greatly dependent on the number of voxels to be created.
