    <h1>What is the GeologicToolbox?</h1>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of the Geologic Toolbox project is to provide software tools which bring geologic data into the GIS world
      and to allow geoscientists the combined use of GIS data (such as traditional base layers, map services, etc.) and
      representations of geologic 3-d models.

    <h2>GeologicToolbox for ArcGIS Pro</h2>
    <p>	
      As a first step, a collection of functions to import geologic layer models and borehole information into ESRI's ArcGIS 
      Pro environment is provided. Basically, the GeologicToolbox comprises of ArcPy scripts that can be executed from
      ArcGIS Pro's user interface.

    <h2>Java Helpers</h2>
    <p>
      Furthermore, additional Java implementations which run independently from ArcGIS Pro can be used. The Java code 
      inside the GeologicToolbox repository mainly addresses Java programmers (although everyone should be able to run 
      them). To execute these helpers a suitable Java Runtime Environment and the current Java-code from the 
      <a href="https://github.com/52North.Triturus" />52n Triturus project</a> is needed.  
    </p>
    <h2>The Future of the Project</h2>
    <p>
      We expect that the offered toolbox functionality will grow soon in the near future. You are welcome to participate!
