    <h1>Concept and functionality</h1>
	<p>
	  Besides the GeologicToolbox for ArcGIS Pro, additionally Java implementations which run independently from ArcGIS Pro 
	  are available. The Java code mainly addresses Java programmers (although principally everyone should be able to run 
	  them). To execute these helpers a suitable Java Runtime Environment and the current Java-code from the 
	  <a href="https://github.com/52North.Triturus" />52n Triturus project</a> is needed.
